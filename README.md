# Nasa Space app 2022
This app was implemented as a solution for a NASA challenge called **Save the Earth from Another Carrington Event!**
We tried our best to find a simple solution with an android app and AI model,we presented our solution in the NASA Space Apps 2022 hackathon
under the name **Coders** as the team name.
You can check out our team on the NASA Space website [Here](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/carrington-event/teams/coders-1/project).
